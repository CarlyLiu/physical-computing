**Week5-Ideation**

For this project I want to make an band through Arduino in which people can experience the fun in conducting. I think this installation will be extremely cool to create. People can conduct through the control of the stick. The project seemed very interesting to me, but it was difficult for me to make it work well alone. yihan has a great visual ability and we decided to work together as a team to make this project better.
